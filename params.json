Creating access tokens/keys\r\n    * goto https://dev.twitter.com, sign in.\r\n    * upper right dropdown, My Applications.\r\n    * Create new application.\r\n    * Goto Settings tab and pick Read and Write Access.\r\n    * click \"Update this Twitter application's settings\" at bottom\r\n    * Under Details tab, click \"Create my access token\". \r\n    * goto OAuth tool tab and grab the 4 keys.\r\n\r\nIn the script I store these keys in /secret/twitter2.config. The format of this file is easy, here's an example:\r\n\r\n    consumer_key        => 'asdfjk',\r\n    consumer_secret     => 'lajflsakjfd',\r\n    token        => 'alskjdflsakjdflk',\r\n    token_secret => 'ajfalkjfd',\r\n  \r\nNow you need to put your profile pictures under ./pool. You can use jpg, gif, or png, I think they'll all work even though the mime_type in the script says image/png.\r\n* Pictures must be < 800 kB and will be scaled down by twitter if too big.\r\n\r\nIf you run the script now, it should upload a random picture to twitter to replace your profile picture. You can run it regularly with cron or trigger it off something else. If you want to change your banner, just uncomment the section in the script that runs \"update_profile_banner\".\r\n\r\nIf the script errors back like this:\r\n\r\n    HTTP Response Code: 401\r\n    HTTP Message......: Unauthorized\r\n    Twitter error.....: Error processing your OAuth request: Read-only application cannot POST at tpc.pl line 37\r\n\r\nJust make sure your Settings is for Read and Write, then recreate your access token in the Details tab. \r\nDon't forget to update your access token and secret in /secret/twitter2.config.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy sample picture pool of files is a subset of sprites from https://code.google.com/p/project6014/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
